# Gianluca Fiore's Personal Wiki

This is a, partly outdated, concise, short references of randomly-collected notes about Programming, System Administration and similiar topics that over years I've found it useful. Sort of a personal reference, or wiki.

These are meant for being quick answers to questions and doubts that may arise, tricks that you may be unaware of and short references about the most disparate subjects within and outside I.T.
