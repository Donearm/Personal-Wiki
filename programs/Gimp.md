###Retouch scanned images

Order of operations: first crop all not needed elements (borders etc.). Then resample to desired size and dpi. Then use blur to remove moiré and paper marks. Then it's the turn of modifying colours, transparency, brightness etc. and finally the image can be sharpened

###Various plugins to try

####Filters->Defocus
* Gaussian
* Selective Gaussian = 6-255 (no moirè); 3-200 (little moiré without getting too out of focus)
