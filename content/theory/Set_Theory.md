### Basics

* `A ⊆ B` = `A` is a subset of `B`. All the members of `A` are also found in `B`
* `A ∪ B` = Union. All the elements that are in `A`, `B` or both
* `A ∩ B` = Intersection. All the elements that are both in `A` and `B`
* `A⊂` = Complement or Absolute complement. The set of all elements that are not in `A` but are in `U`, which is the universal set, basically a superset of all sets defined
* `A⊂ ∩ B` = Relative complement. The set of elements that are not in `A` nor in `A ∩ B`
* `A ∆ B` = Symmetric difference. The set of elements that is in either one of the sets, but not in both
* `A x B` = Cartesian product. The set whose elements are all the ordered pairs of `A` and `B`. Like `A = {1,2,3}` and `B = {4,5,6}` will result in a Cartesian product of {% raw %} `{{1,4}, {1,5}, {1,6}, {2,4}, {2,5}, {2,6}, {3,4}, {3,5}, {3,6}}`{% endraw %}
