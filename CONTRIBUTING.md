Thanks for wanting to contribute to my Personal Wiki repository!

I welcome submissions that fix typos and correct wrong or misleading content. All you need to do is fork the repo, make a single commit with a concise, descriptive message, and then submit it as a pull request.

If you are interested in contributing your own content, I encourage you first to think about the kind of contribution you want to make. I'd like to keep this repo as a short, concise and "tricks&tips" collection of knowledge more than whole tutorials or a complete reference. It is meant to be something that you quickly look up for an answer, not a course or a small book.

Therefore, do feel free to open an issue to discuss your contribution. If it fits the above, I'll gladly accept it!

For any other questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
