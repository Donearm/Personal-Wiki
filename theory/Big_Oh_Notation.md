### Basic definitions

* `O(1)` = constant: the operation doesn't depend on the size of its input
* `O(n)` = linear: the run time complexity is proportionate to the size of `n`
* `O(log n)` = logarithmic: normally associated with algorithms that break the problem into smaller chunks
* `O(n log n)` = just `n` log `n`: usually associated with an algorithm that breaks the problem into smaller chunks per each invocation, and  then takes the results of the smaller chunks and stitches them back together
* `O(n²)` = quadratic
* `O(n³)` = cubic
