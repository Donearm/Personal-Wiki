## ElasticIPs

ElasticIPs are public IP addresses associated with a VPC. The difference with normal public IP addresses is if the instance associated with an ElasticIP goes down, the IP is maintained and associated to the new instance brought up to cover the failed one. This way no interruption of connection is caused by changing the IP address.
